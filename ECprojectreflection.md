# Reflection on my Collaborative Fabrication Project in the EC Lab
Our group created the project titled, Divinity Behind Bars: A Laser Cut Visualization of Faith in the Umpire. This project extrapolated word frequency data from The Umpire dataset in the visualization of a histogram, overlaying an etched image of Eastern State Penitentiary. The process of brainstorming our design, evaluating materials, and assembling the project describes our critical making journey towards shaping the dataset we pulled from The Umpire and forming a potential audience's interaction with it.

## Teamwork and My Role
Before we could begin brainstorming our approach to the project, we began our first meeting by going over the expectations and  dividing responsibilities. Upon taking the role of Project Manager, I set goals along a timeline to complete the project with the two class periods we had in the Education Commons Lab. I also set agendas for our zoom meetings that were held outside of class time, with action items to be completed within the meeting as well as before the next class. By leading these meetings with a strong and organized agenda, we were able to seamlessly collaborate by executing each delegated team function in a timely manner. I also restructured the notes that were well recorded  by our documentarian into actionable items. Our effective collaboration in planning the project also made for very fruitful brainstorming, as each team member came prepared with ideas and inspiration that we built off of to critically create our project.

## The Brainstorming process: 
We began our brainstorming by evaluating the abilities of the fabrication machines in the EC, and concluding that we were most interested and comfortable using the laser cutter. This decision guided the rest of our brainstorming process as we planned for a creation that would be well suited for the laser cutter. Next, we evaluated The Umpire and discussed patterns and themes within the data. Baseball and religion arose as salient themes in our search, and so we began brainstorming creative ways to critically present either of these themes with the laser cutter. We pulled word count frequencies from the set of words pertaining to both themes, and thought about how to present this data. The ideas of a word cloud, a baseball medal or trophy,  and a 3D graph were discussed before we settled on focusing on the religion theme. This focus eliminated the baseball medal visualization from our brainstorm, and so we created a rudimentary visualization of both the word cloud and a histogram to present the religious word frequencies. In comparing these visualizations at this step, we reflected on the bar graph installation that we viewed during the class trip to Eastern State Penitentiary and how the histogram we created has a bit of similarity to that. This experience was in alignment with the type of relationship we wanted to promote with the dataâ€“ one in which the audience can see the frequency of religious thematic language clearly and as a vehicle to contextualize what the human condition was like at Eastern State. With this in mind, we moved forward with the histogram plan and the resolve to create an artifact that presented the quantitative data clearly with elements of design that would engender reflection and an experience in which the audience could see themselves in the project to think critically about the human experience within the story that the data represents. 

## Design, Decision making, and Critical Reflection
The word frequencies were pulled from the Umpire and visualized as a histogram (see code section at the bottom of our note taking sheet) before it was formatted in Illustrator to be compatible with the laser cutter. In designing the histogram in Illustrator, we made intentional decisions to position the bar representing the highest frequency in the middle of the visualization. We believed this would guide the  audience to look through the entirety of the design from end to end by directing eyes towards the middle at first.

Next, we were tasked with deciding what material we would print and etch the histogram onto in the laser cutter. We examined solid colored acrylic, iridescent acrylic, and wood. I originally felt as though the wooden material would be the most impactful backdrop for the message we were creating, as it has the most similar material properties to the architecture of Eastern State Penitentiary. Upon further consideration and experimentation with iridescent acrylic, we decided to move forward with that material because its transparent property allowed for the etched words to illuminate in a way that effectively compounded the religious messaging we were displaying and allowed for ones reflection to be seen within the artifact which further promotes the personal reflection we were trying to foster within the audience.

As the histogram was printed in the laser cutter, we collaboratively evaluated how we would design the base of the histogram so it could stand independently. We designed a sample base with a box to be cut out through the laser cutter, but that box ended up being too large for the printed histogram to be securely inserted. We troubleshooted this by measuring the base of the histogram and resizing the allotted box with a tool called digital callipers for accuracy. We were also taught how the laser cutter works by size/second, and adjusted the speed of the machine to 2 inches/second from 1.5 inches/ second to allow for a sharper and more accurate cut through the thin acrylic material.

Once the base printed, the final step was to assemble the histogram and base into one standing artifact, which was glued together using a solution that can melt acrylic. We designed the base in illustrator to feature the panopticon etched into the base with the allotted channel for the histogram to go through the center of it. This design feature was intentionally set so that audiences would not only see their own reflection in the artifact, but also see how the narrative it represents was housed in the structure etched below it. This was designed to emulate the feeling we experienced when looking at the incarceration rates over time at installation at the end of the Eastern State Penitentiary tour, in the middle of the yard that once contained incarcerated people.
