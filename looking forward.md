# Looking Forward

  As a pre-law student fascinated by the intersection of law and technology, I am looking forward to how I can leverage my learnings in this class to continue employing critical frameworks towards data. I have enrolled in COMM 4190 Talking with AI: Computational and Communication approaches towards engaging with AI in which I plan to continue the practice of thinking critically about the inevitable bias within data that trains AI, and how that should inform our use of AI output in a justice oriented way. I also want to continue participating in workshops offered by Penn Libraries, and I will be signing up for a workshop to learn bookbinding with different stitches. I would also like to continue building my digital portfolio on github to present my interests in the niche of responsible AI and media governance. I plan to work towards this by gathering my writing on these topics for other classes and incorporating it into my github. Lastly, I have already found myself searching for skeuomorphism within AI innovations by reading into the precursors to AI with chat gpt-like interface like that of ELIZA, and the work of Alan Turing.
